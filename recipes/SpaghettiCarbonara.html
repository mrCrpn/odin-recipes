<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
    <li>8 ounces (8 slices) bacon, cut 1 inch thick crosswise</li>
    <li>Coarse salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>3 large eggs</li>
    <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese, plus more for serving</li>
    <li>½ cup half-and-half</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Set a large pot of water to boil (for pasta). In a large skillet, cook bacon over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 8 to 12 minutes; transfer to a paper-towel-lined plate. Salt boiling water generously; add pasta and cook until al dente, according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together eggs, Parmesan, and half-and-half. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Drain pasta, leaving some water clinging to it.</li>
    <li>Working quickly, add hot pasta to egg mixture.</li>
    <li>Add bacon; season with salt and pepper, and toss all to combine (heat from pasta will cook eggs). Serve immediately, sprinkled with additional Parmesan cheese.</li>
